# brevis-utils

The brevis-utils library was split off from [brevis](http://brevis.us/) to separate parameter, math, and distributed 
computing functionality from the core brevis library.

Cluster computing library support for:
- PBS
- LSF
- SLURM

Special thanks to [Alex Bardasu](https://github.com/phreakazoid21) for his initial work on cluster support in brevis.
